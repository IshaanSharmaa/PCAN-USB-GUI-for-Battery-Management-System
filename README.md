# PCAN-USB-GUI-for-Battery-Management-System

### Hello,
This is my code on PCAN Monitoring and Recording Program used to callibrate a Battery Management System. Even tho it is centralised around the use and instructions of the BMS the read and write code used for the PCAN-USB can be used anywhere.

The PCAN integration, GUI file, Storage files have all been saved in different files for ease of access. Their names are descriptive enough to understand their function.
The GUI is integrated in PYQT5 library of python language. Thus the GUI was made using a tool called the Qt Designer, which is available on the net quite easily.

### Prerequistes include:
* Python 3.10
* Pandas
* NumPy
* PyQt5
* PyQt5 - Tools

### Directory Files for PCAN (already present in the Git):
* PCANBasic
* ProcessMessageCanFunc
* ManualRead

### Working of the files can be seen in the links given below
